## Installation

### Prerequisites
Before you can run or contribute to the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (version 3.6+)
- pip (Python package installer)
- Robot Framework
- PyQt6 (for GUI)
- pabot (optional, for parallel test execution)

### Steps to Install

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/robot-runner.git
    cd robot-runner
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

    - **Windows**:
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - **macOS/Linux**:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. (Optional) Install Robot Framework and Pabot globally if you don't have them:

    ```bash
    pip install robotframework
    pip install pabot
    ```

## Building the Application

If you'd like to modify and build the application from source, follow these steps.

### Steps to Build

1. Install the required dependencies:

    Run the following command to ensure all dependencies are installed:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Run the application:

    You can run the app directly with:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Building an Executable

If you need to distribute the application to users without requiring them to install Python, you can build a standalone .exe file (for Windows) using PyInstaller.

### Steps to Build the Executable using a pre-build script shell
In order to generate the executable `exe` file you just need to run the script :

1. For Linux:
    ```bash
    sudo apt get bash
    bash ./build.sh
    ```
2. For windows:
    ```bash
    ./build.sh
    ```

### Steps to Build the Executable

1. Install PyInstaller:

    ```bash
    pip install pyinstaller
    ```

2. Create the executable:

    Run the following command in the project root directory to build the .exe file:

    ```bash
    pyinstaller --onefile --windowed main.py
    ```

    - `--onefile`: Bundles everything into a single executable file.
    - `--windowed`: Prevents a command prompt window from appearing when you run the app (for GUI apps).

    After building, you can find the `.exe` file in the `dist` folder.

3. (Optional) If you want to package the .exe with additional resources (e.g., icons, images), you can modify the PyInstaller command to include them:

    ```bash
    pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --add-data "./style/style.qss;style" --add-data "images/*;images" main.py
    ```

    Make sure to adjust paths as needed for your project structure.
